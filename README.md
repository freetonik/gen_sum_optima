# gen_sum_optima
This is the simplest generic genetic algorithm for finding the sum optima.

The goal is to maximize the sum of Xi, where i is a binary number taken from {0,1}; the sum is bounded by l, which is set in .h file. You can also specify the population size, number of generations, number of mutate points and the size of tournament (for tournament selection).
